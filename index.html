        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p class="intro">I am an Information Technology Engineering Undergraduate from NIT, Srinagar.
          I've an inate love for writing code to solve complex problems and I've been programming since the last 5 years.
          My go-to language is Java but I am also a huge Python fan and it has led me to develop a keen interest in Machine Learning.  <br>
          In my free time, I enjoy video gaming, cooking and stock trading.</p>

          <h3>Line Encoder and Scrambler Using Python |<a class="aa" href="https://github.com/irtiqamalik02/LineEncoder">GitHub</a></strong> </h3>
          <p>Line Coding Schemes was a part my digital communication course at college
          and I thought implementing these might result in better understanding of the underlying concepts. Line coding is the process of converting digital data to digital signals.
          It refers to the waveform pattern of voltage or current used to represent the 1s and 0s of a digital signal on a transmission link.
          In this project I have implemented line coding schemes including NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, Differential Manchester, AMI and scrambling techniques
          like HDB3 and B8ZS using Python.</p>

          <h3>Spam Filter |<a class="aa" href="https://github.com/irtiqamalik02/SpamFilter">GitHub</a></h3>
          <p>Developed a model on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the filtration of spam emails in order to enhance online security.
          It used Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm to block spam emails based on the sender as well as the content of the mail.
          It had an accuracy of 99%.</p>

          <h3>Car Sales Predictor |<a class="aa" href="https://github.com/irtiqamalik02/ANN-CarSales">GitHub</a></h3>
          <p>Built an artificial neural network model to predict car sales. The amount that the customer would spend on buying a car can be predicted based on the information provided by the customer.</p>

          <h3>Sentiment Analysis For Depression Prediction [2020-Present] </h3>
          <p>I am currently working on this project and the key objective is to determine using Natural Language Processing if a person has depression, how severe it is, and based on that provide the user with means to deal with it.
            I aim to diagnose depression using NLP and ML (BERT-based model) and automate cognitive behaviour therapy using chatbots. </p>
